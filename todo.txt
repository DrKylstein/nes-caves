proper animation sequencing with per-entity counters
hold ER pointer in ram so that entities can change routines dynamically?
-ditch index and combine xhi/yhi
hold frame pointer/index in entity field instead of animation? 
-entites would manage their own animation and  non-animated would save time
store size and shared offset instead of individual offsets in frames?
-denser, can re-use y coordinate on horizontal runs
