must:
fix corrpution/bad collision in left side of level
slime direction change is poor
hp display not reseting on restart/exit
add ending image
more sounds
-power ups
-chests
-bullet impacts
-flames
-getting hit
-popup messages
-enemy shots
fall off elevator if pushed into ceiling
add hidden crystals
add wall snake
low gravity
enter animation
find different substitute for trike or implement it (can't kill eye creature in that space)
add walker? (different attack from robot)

long shot:
shoot/just fired animation
double up channels so that long notes can resume after very short ones
music
enemy hit flash

optimizations:
condense faucet into one entity - it doesn't drip if the player is above, 
 which is the most likely case for when it could fall offscreen.
delete entity speeds table
delete entity initial anim table
hold ER pointer in ram so that entities can change routines dynamically?
-ditch index and combine xhi/yhi
store size and shared offset instead of individual offsets in frames?
-faster? denser, can re-use y coordinate on horizontal runs

eyemonster/rex
ball/trike
caterpillar/hammer

add stars to map?
disable tile animation in other levels? (move to an entity or use level number?)
ditch planet parallax and fix platform jitter?
replace big spike pit in level 8 with tiles?
