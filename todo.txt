fix: when a long message is overwritten by a short one, the last letters remain
ball sleep time still too long? randomized?
powershot pickup sound
gravity pickup sound
stop pickup sound
strength mushroom sound
bullet hit solid wall sound
block explode sound
enemy death sound
enemy not hurt sound
flame sound
pellet shot sound
web shot sound
egg shot sound
egg crack sound
enter level sound
all crystals sound
elevators and cannons have been seen shifted 8 pixels away from their spot
fix: narrow switch collision changes level 14 dynamic
add ending image
condense faucet into one entity - it doesn't drip if the player is above, 
-which is the most likely case for when it could fall offscreen.
re-enable cheats for debug builds?

long shot:
convert most player variables to entity variables, move player code to player entity?
delete entity speeds table
delete entity initial anim table
store size and shared offset instead of individual offsets in frames?
-faster? denser, can re-use y coordinate on horizontal runs
enter animation
shoot/just fired animation
variable length notes - patch loop point, external decay?
different note volumes
double up channels so that long notes can resume after very short ones

for sequel/level pack:
fix: eyemonster walks partially inside walls, can push left eye into negative x

Alternative entity storage
ROM:
-index to initialization routine ;1*Stored*Levels
-initial tile (x,y) ;2*Stored*Levels
RAM:
for all entities:
-latest tile (x,y) (some null value for dead or uninitialized?) ;2xMax
-index to active entity fields, or null ;1xMax
for active entities:
-sub-tile and? sub-pixel coords? 4.4 ;2xActive
-current routine ptr ;2xActive
-velocity 4.4 x and y ;2xActive
-variables ;2xActive (external physics, so can't reuse velocity, so count+velocity's worth)
-animation index ;1xActive
-frame counter ;1xActive

3xStoredxLevels
3xMax + 10xActive

30 max, 10 active: 90+100 = 190
30 fixed, current (x8) fields: 240
50 saved
save > 1.6 per max entity

[don't! would have to iterate either way, just check for null pointers]use bitmap to track usage of active fields (8 active or 16 active)

32 max, 8 active: 96+80 = 176
32 fixed: 256
80 saved
save 2.5 per entity
break even at 16 active
